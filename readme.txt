This plugin informs website visitors to update their out-dated browser in an unobtrusive way.

== Description ==
Many internet users are surfing with out-dated browsers for several reasons (mainly because they do not know how to update). Switching to a newer browser is better in terms of security and reliability. This plugin informs your visitors to switch to a newer browser in an unobtrusive way. Just activate this plugin and you and your visitors are good to go...
