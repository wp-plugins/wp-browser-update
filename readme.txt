This plugin informs website visitors to update their out-dated browser in an unobtrusive way.

== Description ==
Many internet users are surfing with out-dated browsers for several reasons (mainly because they do not know how to update). Switching to a newer browser is better in terms of security and reliability. This plugin informs your visitors to switch to a newer browser in an unobtrusive way. Just activate this plugin and you and your visitors are good to go…

Go to <a href="http://browser-update.org/" title="browser-update.org" target="_blank">browser-update.org</a> for more information.

If you wish to contribute your own language, please have a look into the plugin’s language folder. There you’ll find WPBU.pot which can be edited with <a href="http://poedit.net/" title="Poedit" target="_blank">Poedit</a>. Alternatively, feel free to drop me a plain-text e-mail with the translated texts and I’ll compile afterwards. Send your translation <a href="mailto:wp-browserupdate@REMOVE-THISsteini.me">to me</a> afterwards. I really appreciate your support!

== Installation ==
1. Unzip file.
2. Upload unzipped folder to /wp-content/plugins/ directory of your WordPress installation.
